# Infrahub Source of Truth

## MCP Server

- **Repository**: [opsmill/infrahub-mcp](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub-mcp)
- **Transport**: stdio via FastMCP (also supports HTTP on configurable port)
- **Requires**: `INFRAHUB_ADDRESS`, `INFRAHUB_API_TOKEN`
- **Python**: 3.13+
- **Dependencies**: `fastmcp`, `infrahub_sdk`

## How Infrahub Differs

Infrahub is not just another IPAM/DCIM tool. Key differentiators:

- **Schema-driven** — define your own infrastructure models (not just built-in IPAM/DCIM). Devices, circuits, IP addresses, services, cloud resources — any infrastructure object can be modeled.
- **Versioned branches** — Git-like branching for infrastructure data. Make changes on a branch, review diffs, merge when approved. No more "who changed this in production?"
- **GraphQL-native** — full GraphQL API for flexible queries, not just REST. Query exactly the fields you need, traverse relationships in a single request.
- **Relationship-first** — rich relationship model between objects with relationship-level filters and traversal.

## MCP Tools (10 tools)

### Node Operations (3 tools)

| Tool | Parameters | What It Does |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| `get_nodes` | `kind, branch?, filters?, partial_match?` | Retrieve all objects of a specific kind with optional filtering and partial matching |
| `get_node_filters` | `kind, branch?` | List available filters for a kind — attribute filters (`attr__value`), relationship filters (`rel__attr__value`) |
| `get_related_nodes` | `kind, relation, filters?, branch?` | Traverse a relationship from a node kind — get connected objects (peers, members, interfaces, etc.) |

### Schema Operations (3 tools)

| Tool | Parameters | What It Does |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| `get_schema_mapping` | `branch?` | List all schema node kinds and generics available in Infrahub (discover what data types exist) |
| `get_schema` | `kind, branch?` | Full schema for a specific kind — attributes, relationships, their types (understand the data model) |
| `get_schemas` | `branch?, exclude_profiles?, exclude_templates?` | Retrieve all schemas, optionally excluding profiles and templates |

### GraphQL Operations (2 tools)

| Tool | Parameters | What It Does |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| `get_graphql_schema` | none | Retrieve the full GraphQL schema from Infrahub (SDL format) |
| `query_graphql` | `query, branch?` | Execute an arbitrary GraphQL query against Infrahub — full flexibility for complex queries |

### Branch Operations (2 tools)

| Tool | Parameters | What It Does |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| `get_branches` | none | List all branches in Infrahub with their details |
| `branch_create` | `name, sync_with_git?` | Create a new branch for isolated infrastructure changes |

## Workflow: Discover Available Data

When first connecting to Infrahub:

1. **List kinds**: `get_schema_mapping` — what infrastructure types are modeled?
2. **Inspect schema**: `get_schema(kind="InfraDevice")` — what attributes and relationships does a device have?
3. **List filters**: `get_node_filters(kind="InfraDevice")` — how can I query devices?
4. **Get nodes**: `get_nodes(kind="InfraDevice")` — list all devices
5. **Report**: infrastructure data model overview with node counts per kind

## Workflow: Infrastructure Audit

When auditing infrastructure state in Infrahub:

1. **Schema overview**: `get_schema_mapping` — discover all kinds
2. **Device inventory**: `get_nodes(kind="InfraDevice")` — all devices
3. **IP addresses**: `get_nodes(kind="InfraIPAddress")` — all IPs (if IPAM is modeled)
4. **Prefixes**: `get_nodes(kind="InfraPrefix")` — all subnets
5. **Relationships**: `get_related_nodes(kind="InfraDevice", relation="interfaces")` — device interfaces
6. **Report**: infrastructure inventory from Infrahub with relationship context

## Workflow: Branch-Based Change

When proposing an infrastructure change:

1. **List branches**: `get_branches` — see existing branches
2. **Create branch**: `branch_create(name="change-123-add-vlan")` — isolate changes
3. **Query current state**: `get_nodes(kind="InfraVLAN", branch="change-123-add-vlan")` — view on branch
4. **Make changes via GraphQL**: `query_graphql(query="mutation { ... }", branch="change-123-add-vlan")`
5. **Verify**: `get_nodes` on branch — confirm changes look correct
6. **Merge**: (via Infrahub UI/API — merge branch to main)
7. **Report**: change summary with before/after branch comparison

## Workflow: GraphQL Exploration

When building custom queries:

1. **Schema**: `get_graphql_schema` — full SDL schema, understand query structure
2. **Test query**: `query_graphql(query="{ InfraDevice { edges { node { name { value } } } } }")`
3. **Filtered query**: `query_graphql(query="{ InfraDevice(name__value: \"core-rtr\") { ... } }")`
4. **Nested relationships**: traverse in a single query via GraphQL nesting
5. **Report**: custom data extraction with exactly the fields needed

## Integration with Other Skills

## Infrahub vs NetBox vs Nautobot

NetClaw supports all three source-of-truth platforms:

| Feature | NetBox | Nautobot | Infrahub |
|---------|--------|----------|----------|
| Origin | DigitalOcean / NetBox Labs | Network to Code | OpsMill |
| Data model | Fixed DCIM/IPAM + custom fields | Fixed DCIM/IPAM + Jobs + custom fields | Fully schema-driven (define any model) |
| Versioning | No branching | No branching | Git-like branches for data |
| API | REST + GraphQL | REST + GraphQL | GraphQL-native |
| MCP tools | Read-write via FastMCP | Read-only IPAM (5 tools) | Read + GraphQL mutations + branches (10 tools) |
| Use when | Standard IPAM/DCIM | Standard IPAM/DCIM (NTC ecosystem) | Custom infrastructure models, versioned changes |

## Important Rules

- **Discover before querying** — always call `get_schema_mapping` first to learn what kinds exist. Don't guess kind names.
- **Use filters** — call `get_node_filters` to learn valid filter syntax before using `get_nodes` with filters.
- **Branch for changes** — create a branch before making mutations via `query_graphql`. Never mutate main directly.
- **GraphQL mutations require authorization** — ensure the API token has write permissions for mutation queries.
- **Partial matching** — use `partial_match=True` in `get_nodes` for fuzzy matching on filter values.
- **Relationship traversal** — use `get_related_nodes` to follow relationships; use `get_schema` to discover relationship names first.
- **Record in GAIT** — log all Infrahub queries, branch operations, and infrastructure changes.

## Environment Variables
