# NetBox Reconciliation

## Golden Rule

**NetBox is READ-WRITE.** The MCP has full API access to create and update devices, IPs, interfaces, VLANs, and cables. However, during reconciliation, discrepancies are reported and ticketed first — they are NEVER auto-corrected without explicit human approval. NetBox is the intended state. If reality differs from NetBox, either the network is wrong or NetBox needs updating. NetClaw can update NetBox when explicitly authorized by the operator.

## How to Call the Tools

### NetBox MCP Server

```bash
python3 $MCP_CALL "python3 -u $NETBOX_MCP_SCRIPT" TOOL_NAME '{"param":"value"}'
```

### pyATS MCP Server (for live device state)

```bash
PYATS_TESTBED_PATH=$PYATS_TESTBED_PATH python3 $MCP_CALL "python3 -u $PYATS_MCP_SCRIPT" TOOL_NAME '{"param":"value"}'
```

## Full Reconciliation Workflow

### Step 1: Collect NetBox Intent

#### 1A: Get Device Inventory from NetBox

```bash
python3 $MCP_CALL "python3 -u $NETBOX_MCP_SCRIPT" netbox_get_objects '{"object_type":"dcim.devices","filters":{"status":"active"},"brief":true}'
```

This returns all active devices. Match against the pyATS testbed to determine which devices can be reconciled.

#### 1B: Get Interfaces from NetBox (per device)

```bash
python3 $MCP_CALL "python3 -u $NETBOX_MCP_SCRIPT" netbox_get_objects '{"object_type":"dcim.interfaces","filters":{"device":"R1"}}'
```

**Extract per interface:**
- Name, type, enabled status
- MTU, MAC address
- Mode (access/tagged), untagged VLAN, tagged VLANs
- Description, label

#### 1C: Get IP Addresses from NetBox (per device)

```bash
python3 $MCP_CALL "python3 -u $NETBOX_MCP_SCRIPT" netbox_get_objects '{"object_type":"ipam.ip-addresses","filters":{"device":"R1"}}'
```

**Extract per IP:**
- Address (CIDR notation)
- Assigned interface
- Status (active, reserved, deprecated)
- Role (primary, secondary, loopback, VIP)

#### 1D: Get Cables from NetBox (per device)

```bash
python3 $MCP_CALL "python3 -u $NETBOX_MCP_SCRIPT" netbox_get_objects '{"object_type":"dcim.cables","filters":{"device":"R1"}}'
```

**Extract per cable:**
- A-side: device, interface
- B-side: device, interface
- Cable type, length, color

#### 1E: Get VLANs from NetBox

```bash
python3 $MCP_CALL "python3 -u $NETBOX_MCP_SCRIPT" netbox_get_objects '{"object_type":"ipam.vlans","filters":{"site":"main-site"}}'
```

### Step 2: Collect Live Device State

#### 2A: Get Interfaces from Device

```bash
PYATS_TESTBED_PATH=$PYATS_TESTBED_PATH python3 $MCP_CALL "python3 -u $PYATS_MCP_SCRIPT" pyats_run_show_command '{"device_name":"R1","command":"show ip interface brief"}'
```

```bash
PYATS_TESTBED_PATH=$PYATS_TESTBED_PATH python3 $MCP_CALL "python3 -u $PYATS_MCP_SCRIPT" pyats_run_show_command '{"device_name":"R1","command":"show interfaces"}'
```

**Extract per interface:**
- Name, admin status (up/down), protocol status (up/down)
- IP address, subnet mask
- MTU, speed, duplex
- Description

#### 2B: Get IP Addresses from Device

```bash
PYATS_TESTBED_PATH=$PYATS_TESTBED_PATH python3 $MCP_CALL "python3 -u $PYATS_MCP_SCRIPT" pyats_run_show_command '{"device_name":"R1","command":"show ip interface"}'
```

**Extract per interface:**
- Primary IP address and mask
- Secondary IP addresses (if any)

#### 2C: Get Neighbor Data from Device

```bash
PYATS_TESTBED_PATH=$PYATS_TESTBED_PATH python3 $MCP_CALL "python3 -u $PYATS_MCP_SCRIPT" pyats_run_show_command '{"device_name":"R1","command":"show cdp neighbors detail"}'
```

```bash
PYATS_TESTBED_PATH=$PYATS_TESTBED_PATH python3 $MCP_CALL "python3 -u $PYATS_MCP_SCRIPT" pyats_run_show_command '{"device_name":"R1","command":"show lldp neighbors detail"}'
```

**Extract per neighbor:**
- Local interface -> Remote device, remote interface
- Remote platform, remote IP

#### 2D: Get VLAN Data from Device

```bash
PYATS_TESTBED_PATH=$PYATS_TESTBED_PATH python3 $MCP_CALL "python3 -u $PYATS_MCP_SCRIPT" pyats_run_show_command '{"device_name":"R1","command":"show vlan brief"}'
```

```bash
PYATS_TESTBED_PATH=$PYATS_TESTBED_PATH python3 $MCP_CALL "python3 -u $PYATS_MCP_SCRIPT" pyats_run_show_command '{"device_name":"R1","command":"show interfaces switchport"}'
```

### Step 3: Diff Engine

Compare NetBox intent vs device reality for each discrepancy type.

#### 3A: IP_DRIFT Detection

For each interface with an IP in NetBox:

```
NetBox:  GigabitEthernet1 -> 10.1.1.1/30
Device:  GigabitEthernet1 -> 10.1.1.5/30
Result:  IP_DRIFT (CRITICAL) - GigabitEthernet1: NetBox=10.1.1.1/30, Device=10.1.1.5/30
```

**Comparison logic:**
1. Get all IPs from NetBox for device R1 (Step 1C)
2. Get all IPs from device R1 (Step 2B)
3. For each NetBox IP assignment:
   - Find the matching interface on the device
   - Compare the IP address and prefix length
   - If different -> IP_DRIFT (CRITICAL)
   - If interface exists but has no IP -> IP_DRIFT (CRITICAL)
4. For each device IP not in NetBox -> IP_DRIFT (CRITICAL) - undocumented IP

#### 3B: MISSING_INTERFACE Detection

```
NetBox:  GigabitEthernet3 (enabled)
Device:  GigabitEthernet3 does not exist
Result:  MISSING_INTERFACE (HIGH) - GigabitEthernet3 exists in NetBox but not on device
```

**Comparison logic:**
1. Get interface list from NetBox (Step 1B)
2. Get interface list from device (Step 2A)
3. For each NetBox interface not found on device -> MISSING_INTERFACE (HIGH)
4. For each device interface not found in NetBox -> MISSING_INTERFACE (HIGH) with note "undocumented"
5. Filter out virtual/internal interfaces that are platform-specific (Null0, NVI0, etc.)

#### 3C: UNDOCUMENTED_LINK Detection

```
CDP:     R1:GigabitEthernet2 -> SW1:GigabitEthernet0/1
NetBox:  No cable record for R1:GigabitEthernet2
Result:  UNDOCUMENTED_LINK (HIGH) - R1:Gi2 -> SW1:Gi0/1 discovered via CDP but not in NetBox
```

**Comparison logic:**
1. Get CDP/LLDP neighbors from device (Step 2C)
2. Get cable records from NetBox (Step 1D)
3. For each CDP/LLDP neighbor:
   - Search NetBox cables for a matching A-side/B-side pair
   - If no cable exists -> UNDOCUMENTED_LINK (HIGH)

#### 3D: CABLE_MISMATCH Detection

```
NetBox:  R1:GigabitEthernet1 -> R2:GigabitEthernet1
CDP:     R1:GigabitEthernet1 -> R3:GigabitEthernet0
Result:  CABLE_MISMATCH (HIGH) - R1:Gi1 NetBox says R2:Gi1 but CDP says R3:Gi0
```

**Comparison logic:**
1. For each NetBox cable involving this device:
   - Look up the corresponding CDP/LLDP entry for the local interface
   - Compare the remote device and remote interface
   - If different -> CABLE_MISMATCH (HIGH)

#### 3E: VLAN_MISMATCH Detection

```
NetBox:  GigabitEthernet2 untagged_vlan=10
Device:  GigabitEthernet2 access vlan 20
Result:  VLAN_MISMATCH (MEDIUM) - GigabitEthernet2: NetBox VLAN=10, Device VLAN=20
```

**Comparison logic:**
1. Get interface VLAN assignments from NetBox (Step 1B, look at untagged_vlan and tagged_vlans)
2. Get interface switchport data from device (Step 2D)
3. Compare access VLAN, trunk allowed VLANs, and native VLAN
4. If different -> VLAN_MISMATCH (MEDIUM)

#### 3F: STATUS_MISMATCH Detection

```
NetBox:  GigabitEthernet3 enabled=true
Device:  GigabitEthernet3 administratively down
Result:  STATUS_MISMATCH (MEDIUM) - GigabitEthernet3: NetBox=enabled, Device=admin-down
```

#### 3G: MTU_MISMATCH Detection

```
NetBox:  GigabitEthernet1 MTU=9000
Device:  GigabitEthernet1 MTU=1500
Result:  MTU_MISMATCH (LOW) - GigabitEthernet1: NetBox MTU=9000, Device MTU=1500
```

### Step 4: Generate Reconciliation Report

Produce a severity-sorted discrepancy table:

```
NetBox Reconciliation Report - R1
Date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC
NetBox Device: R1 | pyATS Device: R1 (devnetsandboxiosxec8k.cisco.com)

CRITICAL:
  [C-001] IP_DRIFT: GigabitEthernet1 - NetBox=10.1.1.1/30, Device=10.1.1.5/30
  [C-002] IP_DRIFT: Loopback0 - NetBox=1.1.1.1/32, Device=2.2.2.2/32

HIGH:
  [H-001] UNDOCUMENTED_LINK: Gi2 -> SW1:Gi0/1 (CDP) - no cable in NetBox
  [H-002] MISSING_INTERFACE: GigabitEthernet4 in NetBox but not on device

MEDIUM:
  [M-001] VLAN_MISMATCH: Gi3 - NetBox VLAN=10, Device VLAN=20
  [M-002] STATUS_MISMATCH: Gi5 - NetBox=enabled, Device=admin-down

LOW:
  [L-001] MTU_MISMATCH: Gi1 - NetBox MTU=9000, Device MTU=1500

Summary: 2 Critical | 2 High | 2 Medium | 1 Low
Overall: CRITICAL - immediate attention required
```

### Step 5: Ticket Critical Discrepancies

For each CRITICAL discrepancy, open a ServiceNow incident:

```bash
python3 $MCP_CALL "python3 -u $SERVICENOW_MCP_SCRIPT" create_incident '{"short_description":"NetBox Drift: IP_DRIFT on R1 GigabitEthernet1","description":"NetBox reconciliation detected IP address drift on R1 GigabitEthernet1.\n\nNetBox intent: 10.1.1.1/30\nDevice reality: 10.1.1.5/30\n\nThis is a CRITICAL discrepancy. Either the device configuration is incorrect and needs remediation, or NetBox needs to be updated to reflect the current state.\n\nDiscovery method: NetClaw automated reconciliation\nDate: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC","urgency":"2","impact":"2","category":"Network"}'
```

For HIGH discrepancies, create incidents at lower urgency:

```bash
python3 $MCP_CALL "python3 -u $SERVICENOW_MCP_SCRIPT" create_incident '{"short_description":"NetBox Drift: UNDOCUMENTED_LINK R1:Gi2 -> SW1:Gi0/1","description":"NetBox reconciliation found a physical link (via CDP) between R1:GigabitEthernet2 and SW1:GigabitEthernet0/1 that has no cable record in NetBox.\n\nAction required: Add cable record to NetBox or investigate if this link is authorized.\n\nDiscovery method: NetClaw automated reconciliation","urgency":"3","impact":"3","category":"Network"}'
```

### Step 6: Generate Markmap Drift Summary

Create a visual mind map of all discrepancies for human review:

```bash
python3 $MCP_CALL "node $MARKMAP_MCP_SCRIPT" markmap_generate '{"markdown_content":"# NetBox Reconciliation - R1\n## CRITICAL\n### IP_DRIFT\n- Gi1: NetBox=10.1.1.1/30 vs Device=10.1.1.5/30\n- Lo0: NetBox=1.1.1.1/32 vs Device=2.2.2.2/32\n## HIGH\n### UNDOCUMENTED_LINK\n- Gi2 -> SW1:Gi0/1 (no cable in NetBox)\n### MISSING_INTERFACE\n- Gi4 (in NetBox, not on device)\n## MEDIUM\n### VLAN_MISMATCH\n- Gi3: NetBox VLAN=10 vs Device VLAN=20\n### STATUS_MISMATCH\n- Gi5: NetBox=enabled vs Device=admin-down\n## LOW\n### MTU_MISMATCH\n- Gi1: NetBox=9000 vs Device=1500"}'
```

### Step 7: Record in GAIT

```bash
python3 $MCP_CALL "python3 -u $GAIT_MCP_SCRIPT" gait_record_turn '{"user_text":"Reconcile NetBox source of truth against R1 live state","assistant_text":"NetBox reconciliation complete for R1.\n\nDiscrepancies found: 2 CRITICAL, 2 HIGH, 2 MEDIUM, 1 LOW\n\nCRITICAL:\n- IP_DRIFT: Gi1 (10.1.1.1/30 vs 10.1.1.5/30)\n- IP_DRIFT: Lo0 (1.1.1.1/32 vs 2.2.2.2/32)\n\nServiceNow incidents created for all CRITICAL and HIGH findings.\nMarkmap drift summary generated.\n\nOverall: CRITICAL - immediate human review required."}'
```

Display the audit trail:

```bash
python3 $MCP_CALL "python3 -u $GAIT_MCP_SCRIPT" gait_show '{"commit":"HEAD"}'
```

## Fleet-Wide Reconciliation

To reconcile all devices, first list the inventory:

```bash
PYATS_TESTBED_PATH=$PYATS_TESTBED_PATH python3 $MCP_CALL "python3 -u $PYATS_MCP_SCRIPT" pyats_list_devices '{}'
```

Then query NetBox for all active devices:

```bash
python3 $MCP_CALL "python3 -u $NETBOX_MCP_SCRIPT" netbox_get_objects '{"object_type":"dcim.devices","filters":{"status":"active"},"brief":true}'
```

Run Steps 1-7 for each device that exists in both the pyATS testbed and NetBox. Produce a fleet summary:

```
Fleet Reconciliation Summary - YYYY-MM-DD
Devices Reconciled: 5/5

+---------+----------+------+--------+-----+----------+
| Device  | CRITICAL | HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW | Overall  |
+---------+----------+------+--------+-----+----------+
| R1      | 2        | 2    | 2      | 1   | CRITICAL |
| R2      | 0        | 1    | 0      | 0   | HIGH     |
| SW1     | 0        | 0    | 3      | 2   | MEDIUM   |
| SW2     | 0        | 0    | 0      | 1   | LOW      |
| FW1     | 0        | 0    | 0      | 0   | CLEAN    |
+---------+----------+------+--------+-----+----------+

Total Discrepancies: 2 CRITICAL | 3 HIGH | 5 MEDIUM | 4 LOW
ServiceNow Incidents Created: 5 (2 CRITICAL + 3 HIGH)
Overall Fleet Status: CRITICAL
```

Sort devices by severity (CRITICAL first) for triage prioritization.

---

## NetBox Changelog Audit

After reconciliation, check NetBox changelogs to understand when the source of truth was last updated:

```bash
python3 $MCP_CALL "python3 -u $NETBOX_MCP_SCRIPT" netbox_get_changelogs '{"filters":{"object_type":"dcim.interface","limit":20}}'
```

This helps determine whether discrepancies are due to recent device changes (device drifted) or stale NetBox data (NetBox was never updated).

## Integration with Other Skills

| Skill | Integration Point |
|-------|------------------|
| **pyats-topology** | Provides CDP/LLDP neighbor data used for UNDOCUMENTED_LINK and CABLE_MISMATCH detection |
| **pyats-health-check** | Run health check first; reconciliation adds NetBox cross-reference layer |
| **servicenow-change-workflow** | CRITICAL and HIGH discrepancies auto-open ServiceNow incidents |
| **markmap-viz** | Drift summary mind map for visual human review |
| **drawio-diagram** | Color-code topology links by reconciliation status (green=match, red=mismatch, yellow=undocumented) |
| **GAIT** | Full reconciliation session recorded in audit trail |

## When to Use

- **Scheduled**: Weekly or monthly source-of-truth validation
- **Post-change**: After every configuration change, verify NetBox still matches reality
- **Incident response**: When investigating an outage, check if NetBox data is accurate for the affected devices
- **New device onboarding**: Verify NetBox was populated correctly after adding a new device
- **Audit/compliance**: Demonstrate that infrastructure documentation matches reality
