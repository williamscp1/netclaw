# Cisco ASA Firewall Operations via pyATS

## Testbed Requirements

ASA devices in the pyATS testbed with `os: asa`:

```yaml
devices:
  asa-fw-01:
    os: asa
    type: firewall
    connections:
      cli:
        protocol: ssh
        ip: 10.0.0.10
        port: 22
    credentials:
      default:
        username: "%ENV{NETCLAW_USERNAME}"
        password: "%ENV{NETCLAW_PASSWORD}"
      enable:
        password: "%ENV{NETCLAW_ENABLE}"
```

## How to Call

```bash
PYATS_TESTBED_PATH=$PYATS_TESTBED_PATH python3 $MCP_CALL "python3 -u $PYATS_MCP_SCRIPT" pyats_run_show_command '{"device_name":"asa-fw-01","command":"<command>"}'

### ARP Table

```bash
pyats_run_show_command '{"device_name":"asa-fw-01","command":"show arp"}'

### ASP (Accelerated Security Path) Drops

```bash
pyats_run_show_command '{"device_name":"asa-fw-01","command":"show asp drop"}'
```
Packets dropped by the ASP — categorized by reason: flow-drop, acl-drop, inspect-drop, rpf-violated, no-route, etc. **Critical for troubleshooting** — reveals why traffic is being blocked.

```
Summary of all active VPN sessions by type: AnyConnect, L2L, WebVPN, clientless, total sessions, peak concurrent.

#### All VPN Sessions
```bash
pyats_run_show_command '{"device_name":"asa-fw-01","command":"show vpn-sessiondb"}'

#### AnyConnect Sessions
```bash
pyats_run_show_command '{"device_name":"asa-fw-01","command":"show vpn-sessiondb anyconnect"}'
```

#### AnyConnect Inactive Sessions
```bash
pyats_run_show_command '{"device_name":"asa-fw-01","command":"show vpn-sessiondb anyconnect sort inactivity"}'
```
AnyConnect sessions sorted by inactivity time — useful for identifying idle sessions consuming licenses.

#### WebVPN Sessions
```bash
pyats_run_show_command '{"device_name":"asa-fw-01","command":"show vpn-sessiondb webvpn"}'
```
Clientless WebVPN sessions: user, duration, bytes, inactivity.

#### VPN Load Balancing
```bash
pyats_run_show_command '{"device_name":"asa-fw-01","command":"show vpn load-balancing"}'
```
VPN cluster load distribution across ASA peers — sessions per member, load percentage.

### IPSec / IKEv2

```bash
pyats_run_show_command '{"device_name":"asa-fw-01","command":"show crypto ikev2 sa"}'
```

### IP Pool

```bash
pyats_run_show_command '{"device_name":"asa-fw-01","command":"show ip local pool vpn-pool"}'
```
VPN IP address pool usage: available, in use, range. **Monitor for pool exhaustion** — running out of addresses blocks new VPN connections.

## Workflows

### 1. ASA Health Check
```
show version → ASA version, model, uptime, last reload
→ show failover → HA state (Active/Standby), peer health
→ show interface ip brief → interface up/down state
→ show resource usage → context resource utilization
→ show asp drop → dropped packet analysis
→ Severity-sort → GAIT
```

### 2. VPN Monitoring Dashboard
```
show vpn-sessiondb summary → total sessions by type, peak concurrent
→ show vpn-sessiondb anyconnect → active AnyConnect users
→ show vpn-sessiondb anyconnect sort inactivity → idle sessions
→ show ip local pool vpn-pool → address pool utilization
→ show vpn load-balancing → cluster distribution
→ show crypto ikev2 sa → IKEv2 tunnel state
→ Flag: pool > 80% used, sessions near license limit, idle > 8h
→ GAIT
```

### 3. ASA Failover Verification
```
show failover → verify Active/Standby state
→ show failover interface → failover link health
→ show interface ip brief → all interfaces match expected state
→ show route → routing table consistent with active role
→ show vpn-sessiondb summary → VPN sessions present on active unit
→ GAIT
```

### 4. ASA Security Audit
```
show version → verify supported ASA version (cross-reference NVD CVE)
→ show asp drop → analyze drop reasons for anomalies
→ show service-policy → policy hit counts, inspect actions
→ show context detail → verify context isolation (multi-context)
→ show traffic → per-interface throughput baseline
→ GAIT
```

### 5. VPN Troubleshooting
```
show vpn-sessiondb anyconnect → verify user session exists
→ show crypto ikev2 sa → IKEv2 tunnel established?
→ show interface ip brief → outside interface up?
→ show route → default route present?
→ show ip local pool vpn-pool → addresses available?
→ show asp drop → packets being dropped for this flow?
→ show service-policy → inspect policies blocking traffic?
→ GAIT
```

## Parallel Operations

Run ASA health checks across multiple firewalls concurrently:

```bash
# ASA Pair - Primary
PYATS_TESTBED_PATH=$PYATS_TESTBED_PATH python3 $MCP_CALL "python3 -u $PYATS_MCP_SCRIPT" pyats_run_show_command '{"device_name":"asa-fw-01","command":"show failover"}'

# ASA Pair - Secondary
PYATS_TESTBED_PATH=$PYATS_TESTBED_PATH python3 $MCP_CALL "python3 -u $PYATS_MCP_SCRIPT" pyats_run_show_command '{"device_name":"asa-fw-02","command":"show failover"}'

# Remote Site ASA
PYATS_TESTBED_PATH=$PYATS_TESTBED_PATH python3 $MCP_CALL "python3 -u $PYATS_MCP_SCRIPT" pyats_run_show_command '{"device_name":"asa-remote-01","command":"show failover"}'
```

## Guardrails

- **All commands are read-only** — show commands only
- **No config changes** — never use `configure terminal` or `write memory` via this skill
- **Monitor VPN pool usage** — alert when pool utilization exceeds 80%
- **Check failover before maintenance** — always verify HA state before any maintenance window
- **Cross-reference with SoT** — compare interface IPs and routes with NetBox
- **Record in GAIT** — every command execution must be logged
