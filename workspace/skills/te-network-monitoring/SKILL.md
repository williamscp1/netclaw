## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Test** | Synthetic probe: HTTP, network (ICMP/TCP), DNS, voice, SIP |
| **Agent** | Vantage point: Enterprise (on-prem), Cloud (Cisco-hosted) |
| **Path Visualization** | Hop-by-hop path showing latency, loss, and MPLS labels per hop |
| **Instant Test** | On-demand test execution for active troubleshooting |
| **Endpoint Agent** | Workstation agent monitoring WiFi, VPN, and SaaS experience |

## Workflow: Network Performance Assessment

When a user asks "how's the network performing?":

1. **List tests**: `te_list_tests` — discover all configured monitoring tests
2. **Test results**: `te_get_test_results` for key network tests — latency, loss, jitter
3. **Alerts**: List Alerts (official) — any active alert conditions
4. **Events**: List Events (official) — recent network/application problems
5. **Dashboards**: `te_list_dashboards` + `te_get_dashboard_widget` — executive summary metrics
6. **Report**: network performance dashboard with test-by-test metrics and alert status

## Workflow: Path Troubleshooting

When investigating "traffic to example.com is slow from the London office":

1. **Find test**: `te_list_tests` filtered by name or target
2. **Path visualization**: `te_get_path_vis` for the relevant test — hop-by-hop path
3. **Full path**: Get Full Path Visualization (official) — all agents, all paths
4. **BGP routes**: Get BGP Route Details (official) — is traffic taking an unexpected AS path?
5. **Anomalies**: Get Anomalies (official) — metric deviations over time
6. **Report**: path analysis with hop-by-hop latency, loss source, and routing assessment

## Workflow: Outage Investigation

When responding to a ThousandEyes alert:

1. **Alerts**: List Alerts (official) — active alert details, affected tests
2. **Events**: List Events (official) + Get Event Details — timeline, impacted targets
3. **Outages**: Search Outages (official) — broader outage scope (ISP, CDN, SaaS)
4. **Path vis**: `te_get_path_vis` — where in the path is the problem?
5. **Instant test**: Instant Tests (official) — run on-demand tests from multiple agents
6. **Report**: outage timeline with root cause (ISP node X, hop Y, BGP route change)

## Workflow: Endpoint Experience

When investigating "users complain about slow VPN":

1. **Endpoint agents**: List Endpoint Agents and Tests (official) — find agents on affected users
2. **Metrics**: Get Endpoint Agent Metrics (official) — WiFi signal, VPN latency, DNS response
3. **Path vis**: Get Path Visualization (official) — user-to-VPN-gateway path
4. **Correlate**: compare with enterprise agent test results — is it user-side or network-side?
5. **Report**: endpoint experience analysis with WiFi, VPN, and path diagnostics

## Workflow: BGP Monitoring

When auditing BGP health:

1. **BGP tests**: `te_list_tests` filtered by type=bgp
2. **BGP results**: Get BGP Test Results (official) — reachability, prefix visibility
3. **Route details**: Get BGP Route Details (official) — AS paths, origin validation
4. **Anomalies**: Get Anomalies (official) — BGP metric deviations
5. **Report**: BGP health summary with route stability assessment

## Integration with Other Skills

|-------|----------------------|
| `pyats-routing` | ThousandEyes external BGP view + pyATS internal routing state = full picture |
| `pyats-troubleshoot` | ThousandEyes path vis (internet view) + pyATS show commands (device view) |
| `aws-network-ops` | ThousandEyes cloud agent tests + AWS VPC flow logs for hybrid visibility |
| `gcp-cloud-monitoring` | ThousandEyes metrics + GCP Cloud Monitoring for cross-platform correlation |
| `meraki-monitoring` | ThousandEyes synthetic tests + Meraki Dashboard live diagnostics |
| `fmc-firewall-ops` | ThousandEyes path vis through firewall + FMC rule audit |
| `servicenow-change-workflow` | ThousandEyes alerts trigger ServiceNow incidents |
| `gait-session-tracking` | Record all ThousandEyes investigations in GAIT audit trail |
| `slack-network-alerts` | Deliver ThousandEyes alert summaries to Slack channels |

## Important Rules

- **Read-only** — community server is read-only; official server has Instant Tests (on-demand test execution)
- **API rate limits** — ThousandEyes API usage counts against your org's rate limit; avoid rapid-fire queries
- **Account group scope** — queries default to the authenticated user's account group; specify `aid` for cross-group queries
- **AI features** — official server requires org not opted out of ThousandEyes AI features
- **Time windows** — use `window` (seconds) or `start`/`end` (ISO 8601) for time-bounded queries
- **Record in GAIT** — log all ThousandEyes investigations for audit trail

## Environment Variables

- `TE_TOKEN` — ThousandEyes API v7 OAuth bearer token (used by both community and official servers)
