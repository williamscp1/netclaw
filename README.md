## Quick Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/automateyournetwork/netclaw.git
cd netclaw
./scripts/install.sh          # installs everything, then launches the setup wizard
```

That's it. The installer deploys 113 skills, installs bundled MCP dependencies, and prepares configuration for 66 MCP integrations, then launches a two-phase setup:

**Phase 1: `openclaw onboard`** (OpenClaw's built-in wizard)
- Pick your AI provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, Bedrock, Vertex, 30+ options)
- Set up the gateway (local mode, auth, port)
- Connect channels (Slack, Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp, etc.)
- Install the daemon service

**Phase 2: `./scripts/setup.sh`** (NetClaw platform credentials)
- Network devices (testbed.yaml editor)
- Platform credentials (NetBox, Nautobot, Infrahub, Infoblox, Itential, ServiceNow, ACI, ISE, F5, Catalyst Center, NVD, Microsoft Graph, GitHub, CML, NSO, Meraki, FMC, Panorama, FortiManager, ThousandEyes, RADKit, AWS, GCP, ContainerLab, SD-WAN, Grafana, Prometheus, Kubeshark)
- Your identity (name, role, timezone for USER.md)

After setup, start NetClaw:

```bash
openclaw gateway              # terminal 1
openclaw tui                  # terminal 2
```

Reconfigure anytime:
- `openclaw configure` — AI provider, gateway, channels
- `./scripts/setup.sh` — network platform credentials

## OpenClaw Workspace Files

NetClaw ships with the full set of OpenClaw workspace markdown files. These are injected into the agent's system prompt at session start to define its identity, behavior, and operating procedures.

| File | Purpose | Loaded When |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **[SOUL.md](SOUL.md)** | Core personality, CCIE expertise, 12 non-negotiable rules, protocol knowledge base | Every session |
| **[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)** | Operating instructions: memory system, safety rules, change management workflow, Slack behavior, escalation matrix | Every session |
| **[IDENTITY.md](IDENTITY.md)** | Name, creature type, vibe, emoji — NetClaw's identity card | Every session |
| **[USER.md](USER.md)** | Your preferences, timezone, role, network details — personalization layer (edit this) | Every session |
| **[TOOLS.md](TOOLS.md)** | Local infrastructure notes: device IPs, SSH hosts, Slack channels, site info (edit this) | Every session |
| **[HEARTBEAT.md](HEARTBEAT.md)** | Periodic health checks: device reachability, OSPF/BGP state, CPU/memory, syslog scan | Every heartbeat cycle |

**How they work:** OpenClaw reads these files at session start and injects them under "Project Context" in the system prompt. Each file is capped at 20,000 characters. Sub-agents only receive AGENTS.md and TOOLS.md.

**What to customize:** Edit `USER.md` with your name, timezone, and preferences. Edit `TOOLS.md` with your device IPs, Slack channels, and site information. The rest define NetClaw's behavior and expertise — modify only if you want to change how the agent operates.

---

## Cisco WebEx Integration

> **Important:** WebEx is **not** a built-in OpenClaw channel. Unlike Slack (which ships as a first-party OpenClaw provider using WebSocket), WebEx is an **add-on** that uses the community [`@jimiford/webex`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jimiford/webex) OpenClaw channel plugin. This plugin delivers inbound messages via **webhooks** — WebEx POSTs to a public HTTPS endpoint whenever someone @mentions your bot. That means you need a publicly reachable URL (ngrok for local development, a real domain for production).

NetClaw's WebEx support is **bidirectional**:

| Direction | How It Works |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Outbound** (NetClaw → WebEx) | Direct REST API calls to `https://webexapis.com/v1/messages` using the bot token. Supports plain text, markdown, Adaptive Cards, file attachments, threaded replies. |
| **Inbound** (WebEx → NetClaw) | The `@jimiford/webex` plugin registers a webhook with WebEx. When a user @mentions the bot, WebEx POSTs to your webhook URL, the plugin routes it to OpenClaw, and the agent responds. |

### Prerequisites

- A **Cisco WebEx account** (free or paid)
- **Node.js 18+** and **OpenClaw 2026.3.x** (already installed if you ran `install.sh`)
- **ngrok** (free tier works) — only required for local/development setups where the gateway is not publicly reachable

### Step 1: Create a WebEx Bot

1. Go to [developer.webex.com/my-apps](https://developer.webex.com/my-apps)
2. Click **Create a New App** → **Create a Bot**
3. Fill in:
   - **Bot Name:** `NetClaw` (or whatever you prefer)
   - **Bot Username:** e.g. `YourOrg_NetClaw` (must be unique)
   - **Icon:** upload one or use a default
   - **Description:** `CCIE-level AI network engineering agent`
4. Click **Add Bot**
5. **Copy the Bot Access Token** — this is shown only once (you can regenerate it later)
   - The token looks like: `ZTA2MmM2MjMt...` (long base64 string)
   - Bot tokens are **long-lived** and do not expire

### Step 2: Add the Bot to a WebEx Space

1. In the WebEx app, create or open a space (e.g., "NetClaw Alerts")
2. Click the space name → **People** → **Add people**
3. Search for your bot by its username (e.g., `YourOrg_NetClaw@webex.bot`) and add it
4. **Copy the Room ID** — you'll need this for environment variables. Get it from:
   - The [WebEx API docs](https://developer.webex.com/docs/api/v1/rooms/list-rooms) → **Try It** → find your space in the results
   - Or use: `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" https://webexapis.com/v1/rooms`

### Step 3: Set Environment Variables

You can set these either by running `./scripts/setup.sh` (interactive wizard) or by manually editing `~/.openclaw/.env`:

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `WEBEX_BOT_TOKEN` | Yes | Bot Access Token from Step 1 |
| `WEBEX_ALERTS_ROOM_ID` | Optional | Default space for CRITICAL/HIGH alert delivery |
| `WEBEX_REPORTS_ROOM_ID` | Optional | Default space for scheduled report delivery |
| `WEBEX_INCIDENTS_ROOM_ID` | Optional | Default space for incident declarations |
| `WEBEX_WEBHOOK_URL` | For inbound | Your public webhook URL (see Step 4) |
| `WEBEX_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Optional | HMAC-SHA1 secret for webhook signature verification |

**Option A — Run the setup wizard:**
```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
```
The wizard prompts for the bot token, room IDs, webhook URL, and webhook secret.

**Option B — Edit `.env` directly:**
```bash
# Add to ~/.openclaw/.env
WEBEX_BOT_TOKEN=ZTA2MmM2MjMtMTM3Ny00ZTA0LTgz...
WEBEX_ALERTS_ROOM_ID=Y2lzY29zcGFyazovL3Vybjp...
WEBEX_REPORTS_ROOM_ID=Y2lzY29zcGFyazovL3Vybjp...
WEBEX_INCIDENTS_ROOM_ID=Y2lzY29zcGFyazovL3Vybjp...
```

> **Outbound-only stops here.** If you only need NetClaw to *send* alerts and reports to WebEx (not receive @mentions), you're done. The WebEx skills will use the bot token and room IDs to post messages via the REST API. Skip to Step 7 to test.

### Step 4: Set Up ngrok (Required for Inbound)

WebEx delivers inbound messages via webhooks — it POSTs to a URL you provide. Your OpenClaw gateway listens on `localhost:18789`, which isn't publicly reachable. [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) creates a secure tunnel from a public HTTPS URL to your local gateway.

1. **Install ngrok** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install ngrok
   # Linux
   curl -sSL https://ngrok-agent.s3.amazonaws.com/ngrok-v3-stable-linux-amd64.tgz | sudo tar xz -C /usr/local/bin
   # Or visit https://ngrok.com/download
   ```

2. **Sign up** at [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com) (free tier is sufficient) and set your auth token:
   ```bash
   ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN
   ```

3. **Start the tunnel:**
   ```bash
   ngrok http 18789
   ```

4. **Copy the HTTPS URL** from the ngrok output:
   ```
   Forwarding  https://a1b2-203-0-113-42.ngrok-free.app -> http://localhost:18789
   ```

5. Your webhook endpoint is:
   ```
   https://a1b2-203-0-113-42.ngrok-free.app/webhooks/webex/default
   ```

> **ngrok free tier caveat:** The URL changes every time you restart ngrok. After restarting, update the `webhookUrl` in `openclaw.json` and restart the gateway. For production, use a stable HTTPS domain or an ngrok paid plan with a fixed subdomain.

### Step 5: Install the WebEx Channel Plugin

The `@jimiford/webex` plugin adds WebEx as a bidirectional channel to OpenClaw (similar to how Slack is built in):

```bash
openclaw plugin install @jimiford/webex
```

Then configure `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`. Add these sections (merge with your existing config):

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "webex": {
      "enabled": true,
      "token": "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN",
      "webhookUrl": "https://a1b2-203-0-113-42.ngrok-free.app/webhooks/webex/default",
      "dmPolicy": "allow"
    }
  },
  "plugins": {
    "allow": ["webex"],
    "entries": {
      "webex": {
        "enabled": true,
        "config": {
          "token": "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN",
          "webhookUrl": "https://a1b2-203-0-113-42.ngrok-free.app/webhooks/webex/default",
          "dmPolicy": "allow"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `YOUR_BOT_TOKEN` with your actual bot token and the ngrok URL with your actual URL.

### Step 6: Enable Cross-Provider Messaging (Optional)

By default, OpenClaw enforces **provider isolation** — a session started from WebEx cannot send messages to Slack, and vice versa. If you want NetClaw to relay messages between channels (e.g., ask NetClaw in WebEx to post an alert to Slack), add this to `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "tools": {
    "message": {
      "crossContext": {
        "allowWithinProvider": true,
        "allowAcrossProviders": true,
        "marker": {
          "enabled": true,
          "prefix": "[from {channel}]"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Cross-provider messages are tagged with a `[from webex]` or `[from slack]` prefix so recipients know the origin.

### Step 7: Start and Test

1. **Make sure ngrok is running** (if using inbound):
   ```bash
   ngrok http 18789
   ```

2. **Start the gateway:**
   ```bash
   openclaw gateway run
   ```

3. **Verify the WebEx provider starts.** You should see these lines in the gateway log:
   ```
   [webex] [default] starting Webex provider (webhook mode)
   [webex] [default] webhooks registered
   [webex] [default] HTTP webhook handler registered at /webhooks/webex/default
   [webex] [default] Webex provider running (webhook mode — waiting for messages)
   ```
   If you see `auto-restart attempt`, something is wrong — check your token and webhook URL.

4. **Test outbound** — from Slack (or the web chat), ask NetClaw to send a message to WebEx:
   ```
   Send a hello world message to the WebEx alerts space
   ```

5. **Test inbound** — in WebEx, @mention the bot:
   ```
   @NetClaw what skills and MCPs do you have?
   ```
   The bot should respond directly in the WebEx space.

### WebEx Skills Reference

WebEx skills use the [WebEx REST API](https://developer.webex.com/docs/api/getting-started) with [Adaptive Cards v1.3](https://developer.webex.com/messaging/docs/buttons-and-cards) for rich interactive formatting, the People API for user-aware routing, and threaded messages via `parentId` for investigation workflows.

| API Endpoint | Used For |
|-------------|----------|
| `POST /v1/messages` | Send text, markdown, and Adaptive Cards to spaces |
| `GET /v1/rooms` | List and create spaces for incidents |
| `GET /v1/people/me` | Bot identity and display name |
| `GET /v1/memberships` | Check who is in a space |
| `POST /v1/webhooks` | Register webhook targets (handled automatically by the plugin) |

### Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| No `[webex]` line in gateway log | Plugin not installed or not enabled | Run `openclaw plugin install @jimiford/webex` and check `openclaw.json` has `plugins.allow: ["webex"]` |
| `auto-restart attempt` loop | Provider starts but immediately exits | Check bot token is valid; check ngrok is running and URL matches config |
| @mention in WebEx gets no response | Webhook not reaching gateway | Verify ngrok is running, URL in `openclaw.json` ends with `/webhooks/webex/default`, and WebEx webhook is registered (check at developer.webex.com → Webhooks) |
| `Cross-context messaging denied` | Provider isolation blocking cross-channel sends | Add `tools.message.crossContext.allowAcrossProviders: true` to `openclaw.json` |
| `404` on webhook POST | URL path mismatch | The gateway listens at `/webhooks/webex/default` (not `/webhooks/webex`) — make sure the `/default` suffix is in your webhook URL |

---

## Cloud

NetClaw extends into public cloud infrastructure. Each cloud provider gets its own set of MCP servers and skills, all driven from the same Slack/WebEx/chat interface as on-prem operations.

### AWS

**6 MCP servers, 5 skills** — networking, monitoring, security, cost, and architecture visualization.

#### Credentials

You need an IAM user with programmatic access. Three values:

| Variable | Example | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | `AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE` | IAM access key ID |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | `wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/...` | IAM secret access key |
| `AWS_REGION` | `us-east-1` | Default region for API calls |

Or use a named AWS CLI profile instead: `AWS_PROFILE=my-profile`

Run `./scripts/setup.sh` — the wizard prompts for all three values.

#### IAM Policy (Minimum Permissions)

Create an IAM policy with these permissions and attach it to your NetClaw IAM user:

```json

      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### What You Can Do

| Skill | Capabilities |
|-------|-------------|
| `aws-network-ops` | List VPCs, inspect subnets/route tables/NACLs, Transit Gateway routes/attachments/peering, Cloud WAN, VPN tunnel status, Network Firewall rules, flow logs, ENI lookup, IP search |
| `aws-cloud-monitoring` | CloudWatch metrics (VPN tunnel state, NAT GW drops, TGW traffic, ELB health), alarms, Logs Insights queries, VPC/TGW flow log analysis |
| `aws-security-audit` | IAM users/roles/policies (read-only), MFA compliance, access key rotation, CloudTrail API event history, incident investigation |
| `aws-cost-ops` | Spending by service/region/tag, monthly trends, forecasts, anomaly detection, network cost drivers (NAT GW $0.045/GB, TGW $0.02/GB) |
| `aws-architecture-diagram` | Auto-discover infrastructure, render VPC/subnet/TGW topology as PNG/SVG/PDF (requires `graphviz`) |

#### Prerequisites

- AWS account with IAM user (programmatic access)
- `graphviz` for architecture diagrams: `apt install graphviz` or `brew install graphviz`
- `uv` (installed automatically by `install.sh`) for running AWS MCP servers via `uvx`

#### Cost Notes

- **Cost Explorer API**: $0.01 per API request — NetClaw batches queries but be mindful of frequent polling
- **CloudWatch Logs Insights**: Charged per GB scanned — use narrow time ranges
- **All other operations**: Standard AWS API calls (no additional charge beyond normal AWS usage)

### GCP (Google Cloud Platform)

**4 remote MCP servers, 3 skills** — compute, monitoring, and logging.

#### Key Difference: Remote HTTP Servers

Google Cloud MCP servers are **remote HTTP endpoints hosted by Google** — nothing to install locally. They use Streamable HTTP transport and authenticate via OAuth 2.0 / Google IAM, not API keys.

| MCP Server | Endpoint | Tools |
|---|---|---|
| Compute Engine | `https://compute.googleapis.com/mcp` | 28 tools — VMs, disks, templates, instance groups, snapshots, reservations |
| Cloud Monitoring | `https://monitoring.googleapis.com/mcp` | 6 tools — time series metrics, alert policies, active alerts, metric discovery |
| Cloud Logging | `https://logging.googleapis.com/mcp` | 6 tools — log search, VPC flow logs, firewall logs, audit logs, buckets |
| Resource Manager | `https://cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/mcp` | 1 tool — project discovery (prerequisite for other servers) |

#### Credentials

You need a Google Cloud project and either a service account or user credentials:

| Variable | Example | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `GCP_PROJECT_ID` | `my-project-123` | Your Google Cloud project ID |
| `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` | `/path/to/key.json` | Path to service account key JSON file |

Or use `gcloud` CLI for user-based auth: `gcloud auth application-default login`

Run `./scripts/setup.sh` — the wizard prompts for project ID and optional service account key path.

#### IAM Roles (Minimum Permissions)

Grant these roles to your service account or user:

| Role | What It Grants |
|------|---------------|
| `roles/compute.viewer` | Read-only access to all Compute Engine resources |
| `roles/monitoring.viewer` | Read-only access to Cloud Monitoring metrics and alerts |
| `roles/logging.viewer` | Read-only access to Cloud Logging log entries |
| `roles/resourcemanager.projectViewer` | Read-only access to project metadata |

For write operations (create/delete VMs via Compute Engine MCP), add `roles/compute.instanceAdmin.v1` — but use ServiceNow CR gating for any changes.

#### What You Can Do

| Skill | Capabilities |
|-------|-------------|
| `gcp-compute-ops` | List/create/start/stop/delete VMs, inspect disks and templates, manage instance groups, discover machine types and images, check reservations and commitments |
| `gcp-cloud-monitoring` | Query time series metrics (CPU, network, disk), list alert policies and active violations, discover available metric types |
| `gcp-cloud-logging` | Search log entries (VPC flow logs, firewall logs, audit logs), discover available logs, inspect log buckets and views |

#### Prerequisites

- Google Cloud project with APIs enabled (Compute Engine, Cloud Monitoring, Cloud Logging)
- Service account key JSON file, or `gcloud` CLI installed and authenticated
- No local install required — servers are hosted by Google

#### Cost Notes

- **Cloud Logging**: Charged per GB scanned beyond 50 GB/month free tier
- **Cloud Monitoring**: Free for GCP metrics; custom metrics charged per time series
- **Compute Engine API calls**: No additional charge

#### Networking Gap

GCP's MCP servers currently cover Compute Engine (VMs) but **not the VPC fabric** — there are no MCP tools for VPC subnets, firewall rules, Cloud VPN, Cloud Interconnect, or Cloud Router. Google is adding more MCP servers regularly, so VPC-specific tools may arrive soon.

### Cisco ThousandEyes

**2 MCP servers, 2 skills** — network monitoring and deep path analysis.

#### Key Difference: Two Complementary MCP Servers

ThousandEyes uses **two MCP servers** that share a single API token:

| MCP Server | Transport | Tools | Strength |
|---|---|---|---|
| Community (`thousandeyes-mcp-community`) | stdio (Python, local) | 9 read-only tools | Core monitoring: tests, agents, path vis, dashboards |
| Official (`api.thousandeyes.com/mcp`) | Remote HTTP (Cisco-hosted) | ~20 tools | Advanced: alerts, outages, BGP, instant tests, endpoint agents, AI |

The community server runs locally via stdio. The official server is a remote HTTP endpoint hosted by Cisco — no local install, accessed via `npx mcp-remote` with Bearer token authentication.

#### Credentials

| Variable | Example | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `TE_TOKEN` | `eyJhbGci...` | ThousandEyes API v7 OAuth bearer token (used by both servers) |

Get your token from: **ThousandEyes > Account Settings > Users & Roles > OAuth Bearer Token**

Run `./scripts/setup.sh` — the wizard prompts for the token.

#### What You Can Do

| Skill | Capabilities |
|-------|-------------|
| `te-network-monitoring` | List tests/agents, query test results, path visualization, dashboard widgets, alerts, events, outages, endpoint agents, anomalies, AI views explanations |
| `te-path-analysis` | Hop-by-hop path analysis (latency, loss, MPLS per hop), BGP route analysis (AS paths, prefix reachability from 300+ global monitors), outage investigation, instant on-demand tests, endpoint VPN diagnostics, BGP hijack/leak detection |

#### Prerequisites

- Cisco ThousandEyes account with API v7 access
- Python 3.12+ (for community MCP server)
- Node.js / npx (for official MCP server via `mcp-remote`)
- Org must not be opted out of ThousandEyes AI features (for official server)

#### Cost Notes

- **Community server tools**: Read-only, no additional cost beyond normal API usage
- **Instant Tests** (official server): Consume ThousandEyes test units — use judiciously
- **API rate limits**: Queries count against your org's ThousandEyes API rate limit

## How Skills Work

Each skill is a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter and markdown instructions. OpenClaw loads them into the agent context at session start.

```markdown
---
name: pyats-health-check
description: "Comprehensive device health monitoring..."
user-invocable: true
metadata:
  { "openclaw": { "requires": { "bins": ["python3"], "env": ["PYATS_TESTBED_PATH"] } } }
---

# Device Health Check

(Step-by-step procedures, show command examples, threshold tables,
 report templates — everything the agent needs to work autonomously)
```

The `metadata.openclaw.requires` block declares binary and environment variable dependencies. The markdown body is the agent's playbook.

Every tool call goes through `scripts/mcp-call.py`, which handles MCP JSON-RPC protocol: initialize, notify, tool call, terminate. No persistent server connections, no port management.

```
python3 mcp-call.py "<server-command>" <tool-name> '<arguments-json>'
```

## Safety

NetClaw enforces non-negotiable constraints at every layer:

**Never guesses device state** — runs a show command or queries NetBox first, always.

**Never touches a device without a baseline** — pre-change state is captured and committed to GAIT before any config push.

**Never skips the Change Request** — ServiceNow CR must exist and be in `Approved` state before execution (except Emergency changes, which require immediate human notification).

**Never runs destructive commands** — `write erase`, `erase`, `reload`, `delete`, `format` are refused at the MCP server level.

**Never auto-quarantines an endpoint** — ISE endpoint group modification always requires explicit human confirmation.

**NetBox is read-write** — NetClaw has full API access to create and update devices, IPs, interfaces, VLANs, and cables in NetBox.

**Always verifies after changes** — if post-change verification fails, the CR is not closed and the human is notified.

**Always commits to GAIT** — every session ends with `gait_log` so the human can see the full audit trail.

---

## GAIT Audit Trail

Every NetClaw session produces an immutable Git-based record of:
- What was asked
- What data was collected (and from where)
- What was analyzed (and what conclusions were reached)
- What was changed (and on what device)
- What the verification result was
- What ServiceNow tickets were created or updated

This is not optional. It is how NetClaw earns trust in production environments.

### What Goes Where

| Location | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `SOUL.md` | Agent system prompt. Defines personality, CCIE expertise, rules, and workflow orchestration |
| `AGENTS.md` | Operating instructions. Memory system, safety rules, change management, Slack behavior, escalation |
| `IDENTITY.md` | Agent identity card. Name, creature type, vibe, emoji |
| `USER.md` | About you. Preferences, timezone, role, network details. **Edit this.** |
| `TOOLS.md` | Local infrastructure. Device IPs, SSH hosts, Slack channels. **Edit this.** |
| `HEARTBEAT.md` | Periodic checks. Device reachability, OSPF/BGP state, CPU/memory, syslog. |
| `workspace/skills/` | Skill source files. `install.sh` copies these to `~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/` |
| `testbed/testbed.yaml` | pyATS device inventory. Referenced by `PYATS_TESTBED_PATH` env var |
| `config/openclaw.json` | Model config template. Sets primary/fallback model only — no MCP config |
| `mcp-servers/` | Tool backends cloned by `install.sh`. Gitignored — rebuilt on install |
| `scripts/mcp-call.py` | Handles MCP JSON-RPC protocol: initialize, notify, tool call, terminate |
| `scripts/gait-stdio.py` | Wraps GAIT MCP server for stdio mode (default is SSE) |

## Testbed Configuration

Edit `testbed/testbed.yaml` to define your network devices:

```yaml
devices:
  R1:
    alias: "Core Router"
    type: router
    os: iosxe
    platform: CSR1kv
    credentials:
      default:
        username: admin
        password: "%ENV{NETCLAW_PASSWORD}"
    connections:
      cli:
        protocol: ssh
        ip: your-device-hostname-or-ip
        port: 22
```

The `%ENV{NETCLAW_PASSWORD}` syntax pulls credentials from environment variables so they stay out of version control.
