# Feature Specification: DevNet Content Search MCP Server Integration

**Feature Branch**: `026-devnet-content-search-mcp`
**Created**: 2026-04-09
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: Integrate Cisco's DevNet Content Search MCP server to enable semantic search of Cisco API documentation for Meraki and Catalyst Center platforms.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Search Meraki API Documentation (Priority: P1)

Network engineers need to quickly find Meraki API documentation for firewall rules, VLAN management, wireless configuration, and OAuth setup without manually navigating DevNet.

**Why this priority**: Meraki is widely deployed in enterprise networks. Engineers frequently need API documentation to automate network management tasks. Instant access to relevant endpoints accelerates automation development.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by searching for "L3 firewall rules" and verifying relevant API endpoints are returned with descriptions and code examples.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** NetClaw is connected to the DevNet Content Search server, **When** the user searches "Meraki L3 firewall rules", **Then** relevant API endpoints for firewall configuration are returned with descriptions and usage examples
2. **Given** NetClaw is connected to the DevNet Content Search server, **When** the user searches "Meraki VLAN management", **Then** VLAN-related API endpoints are returned with parameter details
3. **Given** NetClaw is connected to the DevNet Content Search server, **When** the user searches with a term that has no matches, **Then** an appropriate "no results" message is displayed

### User Story 2 - Search Catalyst Center API Documentation (Priority: P1)

Network engineers need to find Catalyst Center API documentation for device inventory management, policy automation, network assurance, and site hierarchy management.

**Why this priority**: Catalyst Center (DNA Center) is the enterprise management platform for Cisco campus networks. Engineers need documentation to integrate automation workflows with Catalyst Center.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by searching for "device inventory" and verifying Catalyst Center device management APIs are returned.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** NetClaw is connected to the DevNet Content Search server, **When** the user searches "Catalyst Center device inventory", **Then** device management API endpoints are returned with implementation guides
2. **Given** NetClaw is connected to the DevNet Content Search server, **When** the user searches "Catalyst Center policy automation", **Then** policy-related API endpoints are returned with workflow examples
3. **Given** NetClaw is connected to the DevNet Content Search server, **When** the user searches "Catalyst Center assurance", **Then** network health and troubleshooting API endpoints are returned

---

### User Story 3 - Lookup Specific Meraki Operation by ID (Priority: P2)

Developers who already know the operation ID need to retrieve the complete OpenAPI specification for that specific endpoint without broad searching.

**Why this priority**: Experienced developers often know exactly which operation they need and want precise documentation rather than search results. This is an efficiency feature for power users.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by looking up "updateNetworkApplianceFirewallL3FirewallRules" and verifying the complete OpenAPI spec is returned.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** NetClaw is connected to the DevNet Content Search server, **When** the user looks up operation ID "createNetworkMerakiAuthUser", **Then** the complete OpenAPI specification for that operation is returned
2. **Given** NetClaw is connected to the DevNet Content Search server, **When** the user looks up an invalid operation ID, **Then** an appropriate error message indicates the operation was not found

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the DevNet server is unreachable? System should display a clear connectivity error.
- What happens when search returns too many results? Results should be limited with option to refine search.
- How does the system handle special characters in search queries? Queries should be sanitized appropriately.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST connect to DevNet Content Search MCP server at the designated remote endpoint
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide ability to search Meraki API documentation using keyword queries
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide ability to search Catalyst Center API documentation using keyword queries
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide ability to lookup specific Meraki operations by operation ID
- **FR-005**: System MUST return API endpoint information including descriptions and code examples
- **FR-006**: System MUST return implementation guides for Catalyst Center APIs
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle server unavailability gracefully with clear error messages
- **FR-008**: System MUST support limiting the number of search results returned
- **FR-009**: System MUST display results in a format suitable for AI assistant integration
- **FR-010**: System MUST be accessible without additional authentication (public API)
- **FR-011**: System MUST register as a remote MCP server in the NetClaw configuration
- **FR-012**: System MUST create skill definitions for Meraki and Catalyst Center search capabilities
- **FR-013**: System MUST update documentation to reflect new skills and capabilities

### Key Entities

- **Search Query**: User's search terms for finding API documentation
- **API Endpoint**: Documentation for a specific REST API operation including path, method, parameters, and examples
- **Operation ID**: Unique identifier for a specific API operation in OpenAPI specification
- **Search Result**: Collection of matching API endpoints with descriptions and metadata

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can find relevant API documentation within 3 search queries for 90% of common use cases
- **SC-002**: Search results are returned within 5 seconds of query submission
- **SC-003**: 100% of Meraki and Catalyst Center API search tools are accessible through NetClaw skills
- **SC-004**: Users can successfully lookup any valid Meraki operation ID and receive complete specification
- **SC-005**: Documentation is updated to reflect 2 new skills (devnet-meraki-search, devnet-catalyst-search)
- **SC-006**: Remote MCP server connection is established without requiring user-provided credentials

## Assumptions

- DevNet Content Search MCP server remains publicly accessible without authentication
- Remote MCP server URL (https://devnet.cisco.com/v1/foundation-search-mcp/mcp) is stable and production-ready
- HTTP/SSE transport is supported by the NetClaw MCP client infrastructure
- Search results from DevNet are structured in a format compatible with AI assistant consumption
- No installation or local setup is required (remote server model)
- Future platform additions (beyond Meraki and Catalyst Center) will be handled as separate features
