# Tasks: Canvas / A2UI Network Visualization

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/005-canvas-a2ui-integration/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Not explicitly requested in the feature specification. Test tasks omitted.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Skill directory**: `workspace/skills/canvas-network-viz/`
- **Components**: `workspace/skills/canvas-network-viz/components/`
- **Library**: `workspace/skills/canvas-network-viz/lib/`
- **Tests**: `workspace/skills/canvas-network-viz/tests/`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Create the skill directory structure and foundational files

- [X] T001 Create skill directory structure per implementation plan at workspace/skills/canvas-network-viz/ with subdirectories components/, lib/, and tests/
- [X] T002 Create SKILL.md with skill metadata frontmatter (name, description, user-invocable, openclaw requires) at workspace/skills/canvas-network-viz/SKILL.md following the grafana-observability SKILL.md pattern
- [X] T003 [P] Create color-scale.js with three-tier health-to-color mapping (green/amber/red/gray) and WCAG 2.1 AA compliant color values, thresholds at 70% warning and 90% critical at workspace/skills/canvas-network-viz/lib/color-scale.js
- [X] T004 [P] Create filter-engine.js with scope filtering by device name, site, device role, severity level, and time range at workspace/skills/canvas-network-viz/lib/filter-engine.js

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete.

- [X] T005 Implement a2ui-renderer.js with the root A2UI JSON envelope builder (version, type, component, props) and error-card output per the A2UI output contract at workspace/skills/canvas-network-viz/lib/a2ui-renderer.js
- [X] T006 Implement data-fetcher.js with MCP tool invocation abstraction supporting pyATS, Grafana, Prometheus, ServiceNow, SuzieQ, and Batfish servers; include per-source status tracking (ok/partial/unavailable) and latency measurement at workspace/skills/canvas-network-viz/lib/data-fetcher.js
- [X] T007 Implement gait-logger.js that emits GAIT audit log entries for each visualization event (type, dataSources, scope, status, renderDurationMs, timestamp) using the existing gait-session-tracking skill mechanism at workspace/skills/canvas-network-viz/lib/gait-logger.js
- [X] T008 Implement graph-layout.js with force-directed layout algorithm for arbitrary topologies and hierarchical layout with spine/leaf detection for structured fabrics; support up to 500 nodes at workspace/skills/canvas-network-viz/lib/graph-layout.js

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - all shared libraries operational. User story implementation can begin.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phases 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 (Topology Maps): Can start after Phase 2
  - US2 (Dashboard Panels): Can start after Phase 2 (independent of US1)
  - US3 (Alert Cards): Can start after Phase 2 (independent of US1/US2)
  - US4 (Change Timelines): Can start after Phase 2 (independent of US1-US3)
  - US5 (Path Trace + Diff): Can start after Phase 2 (independent of US1-US4)
  - Health Scorecards: Can start after Phase 2 (shares data pipeline patterns with US1/US2)
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **US1 (Topology Maps, P1)**: No dependencies on other stories. Uses graph-layout.js, color-scale.js, filter-engine.js from Phase 2.
- **US2 (Dashboard Panels, P2)**: No dependencies on other stories. Uses color-scale.js from Phase 2.
- **US3 (Alert Cards, P3)**: No dependencies on other stories. Uses filter-engine.js from Phase 2.
- **US4 (Change Timelines, P4)**: No dependencies on other stories. ServiceNow-specific.
- **US5 (Path Trace + Diff, P5)**: No dependencies on other stories. Path trace benefits from topology context (US1) but is independently functional.
- **Health Scorecards**: Shares health metric fetching patterns with US1 and US2 but is independently implementable.

### Within Each User Story

- CSS and JS component files can be created in parallel [P]
- Data pipeline implementation depends on data-fetcher.js from Phase 2
- Component wiring into a2ui-renderer.js depends on component and pipeline completion
- GAIT logging depends on gait-logger.js from Phase 2

### Parallel Opportunities

- T003 and T004 (Phase 1) can run in parallel
- T005, T006, T007, T008 have minimal overlap but T006 (data-fetcher) and T007 (gait-logger) can be parallelized
- Within each user story: CSS and JS component creation can run in parallel
- All user stories (Phases 3-8) can proceed in parallel after Phase 2
- All Phase 9 artifact coherence items (T045-T051) can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Topology Maps)

```bash
# Launch CSS and JS component creation in parallel:
Task: "Create topology-map.css at workspace/skills/canvas-network-viz/components/topology-map.css"
Task: "Create topology-map.js at workspace/skills/canvas-network-viz/components/topology-map.js"

# Then sequentially:
Task: "Implement topology data pipeline in data-fetcher.js"
Task: "Implement site-based clustering logic"
Task: "Implement topology filtering"
Task: "Implement graceful degradation"
Task: "Implement empty-data handling"
Task: "Wire topology-map into a2ui-renderer.js"
```

## Parallel Example: Phase 9 (Artifact Coherence)

```bash
# Launch all artifact updates in parallel:
Task: "Update README.md"
Task: "Update scripts/install.sh"
Task: "Update SOUL.md"
Task: "Update TOOLS.md"
Task: "Update .env.example"
Task: "Update ui/netclaw-visual/"
Task: "Update config/openclaw.json"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T004)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T005-T008)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 - Topology Maps (T009-T016)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test topology map with "show me the network topology"
5. Deploy/demo if ready - this alone delivers significant visual value

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup + Foundational -> Foundation ready
2. Add Topology Maps (US1) -> Test independently -> Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add Dashboard Panels (US2) -> Test independently -> Deploy/Demo
4. Add Alert Cards (US3) -> Test independently -> Deploy/Demo
5. Add Change Timelines (US4) -> Test independently -> Deploy/Demo
6. Add Path Trace + Diffs (US5) -> Test independently -> Deploy/Demo
7. Add Health Scorecards -> Test independently -> Deploy/Demo
8. Polish + Artifact Coherence -> Final release

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: US1 (Topology Maps) + Health Scorecards
   - Developer B: US2 (Dashboard Panels) + US3 (Alert Cards)
   - Developer C: US4 (Change Timelines) + US5 (Path Trace + Diffs)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
4. Team completes Phase 9 (Artifact Coherence) together

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story is independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- All visualizations output A2UI JSON per contracts/a2ui-output-contract.md
- All visualization events GAIT-logged per FR-011
- No new MCP servers created; skill consumes existing MCP tools only
- Three.js HUD at ui/netclaw-visual/ remains untouched until Phase 9 (new node added only)
