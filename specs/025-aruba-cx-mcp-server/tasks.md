## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on T004 (openclaw.json registration)
- **User Story 1-4 (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can proceed in parallel or sequentially in priority order
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: No dependencies on other stories - MVP candidate
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: No dependencies on other stories - can run parallel to US1
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: No dependencies on US1/US2 - can start after Foundational
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: No dependencies on US1-3 - can start after Foundational

### Within Each User Story

- SKILL.md created first (frontmatter defines skill)
- Tools documented in dependency order (read tools before write tools)
- Workflow examples after tool documentation
- Error handling last

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 Parallel Tasks**:
- T002, T003 can run in parallel (different files)

**Phase 2 Parallel Tasks**:
- T005, T006, T007, T008 can ALL run in parallel (different directories)

**User Stories Parallel**:
- US1, US2, US3, US4 can ALL run in parallel after Phase 2 (different skill directories)

**Phase 7 Parallel Tasks**:
- T036, T037, T038, T039, T043 can run in parallel (different files)

---

## Parallel Example: Full Team Execution

```bash
# Phase 1 - Sequential (dependencies)
T001: Add git clone to install.sh
T002 & T003: [PARALLEL] Add pip install + env vars
T004: Register in openclaw.json

# Phase 2 - Parallel (independent directories)
T005 & T006 & T007 & T008: [PARALLEL] Create all skill directories

# Phase 3-6 - Parallel (independent user stories)
Developer A: T009-T014 (User Story 1 - System Discovery)
Developer B: T015-T020 (User Story 2 - Interface Monitoring)
Developer C: T021-T026 (User Story 3 - Switching Operations)
Developer D: T027-T035 (User Story 4 - Config Management)

# Phase 7 - Parallel then Sequential
T036 & T037 & T038 & T039 & T043: [PARALLEL] Documentation updates
T040-T042: [SEQUENTIAL] Validation
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T004)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T005-T008)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T009-T014)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test system discovery per quickstart.md Scenario 1
5. Deploy/demo if ready - engineers can now inventory switches

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup + Foundational → MCP server cloned and registered
2. Add US1 → System Discovery available → Demo MVP!
3. Add US2 → Interface Monitoring available → Demo
4. Add US3 → Switching Operations available → Demo
5. Add US4 → Config Management available → Full feature complete
6. Polish → All artifacts coherent → PR ready

### Single Developer Strategy

Execute in priority order:
1. Phase 1: Setup
2. Phase 2: Foundational
3. Phase 3: User Story 1 (P1) - MVP
4. Phase 4: User Story 2 (P1)
5. Phase 5: User Story 3 (P2)
6. Phase 6: User Story 4 (P2)
7. Phase 7: Polish

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [US#] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story is independently completable and testable
- Manual verification via quickstart.md scenarios (no automated tests)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- All write operations (US3, US4) must document ITSM gating per constitution
