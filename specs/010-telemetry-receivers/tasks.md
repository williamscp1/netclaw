# Tasks: Telemetry & Event Receiver Capabilities

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/010-telemetry-receivers/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are NOT explicitly requested in the specification - focusing on implementation tasks only.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Based on plan.md structure:
- **MCP servers**: `mcp-servers/{server-name}/`
- **Skills**: `workspace/skills/{skill-name}/`

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories CAN proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3 → P4)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1 - Syslog)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2 - SNMP)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent of US1
- **User Story 3 (P3 - IPFIX)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent of US1/US2
- **User Story 4 (P4 - gNMI)**: Can start after Foundational - Validation only, no new code dependencies

### Within Each User Story

- Models FIRST (parallel within story)
- Parser/Decoder second (depends on models)
- Storage third (depends on models)
- MCP Server tools fourth (depends on parser + storage)
- Documentation last (parallel with MCP server)

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (all parallel)**:
```
T001, T002, T003, T004 can all run in parallel
```

**Phase 2**:
```
T008, T009, T010 can run in parallel after T007
```

**User Story 1 Models (parallel)**:
```
T012, T013, T014, T015 can all run in parallel
```

**User Story 2 Models (parallel)**:
```
T033, T034, T035, T036, T037 can all run in parallel
```

**User Story 3 Models (parallel)**:
```
T056, T057, T058, T059, T060 can all run in parallel
```

**All User Stories in parallel** (if team capacity):
```
After Phase 2: US1, US2, US3, US4 can all proceed simultaneously
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Syslog)

```bash
# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create SyslogMessage Pydantic model in mcp-servers/syslog-mcp/models.py"
Task: "Create SyslogFacility and SyslogSeverity enums in mcp-servers/syslog-mcp/models.py"
Task: "Create SyslogQueryFilter model in mcp-servers/syslog-mcp/models.py"
Task: "Create ReceiverStatus model in mcp-servers/syslog-mcp/models.py"

# After models complete, launch parser tasks sequentially:
Task: "Implement RFC 5424 syslog parser..."
Task: "Implement RFC 3164 BSD syslog fallback parser..."

# Launch documentation in parallel with MCP server implementation:
Task: "Create README.md for syslog-mcp..." (parallel)
Task: "Create SKILL.md for syslog-receiver..." (parallel)
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Syslog)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test syslog receiver with Catalyst 9300 via Pinggy tunnel
5. Deploy/demo if ready - this is a working MVP!

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 (Syslog) → Test independently → **MVP Demo!**
3. Add User Story 2 (SNMP) → Test independently → Demo trap receiving
4. Add User Story 3 (IPFIX) → Test independently → Demo flow analysis
5. Add User Story 4 (gNMI) → Validate → Complete telemetry suite

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Syslog)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (SNMP)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (IPFIX)
   - Developer D: User Story 4 (gNMI validation)
3. Stories complete and can be demoed independently

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story is an **independent MCP server** that can be deployed separately
- **ngrok does NOT support UDP** - use Pinggy or Tailscale for tunneling (see research.md)
- All receivers use in-memory storage (data lost on restart - acceptable for demo)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
