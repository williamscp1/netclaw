# Specification Quality Checklist: Azure Networking MCP Server

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-03-26
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass. Spec is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
- The spec covers 11 Azure networking service areas (VNet, NSG, Firewall, ExpressRoute, VPN Gateway, Load Balancer, Application Gateway, Front Door, Network Watcher, Private Link, Route Tables, DNS) completing the multi-cloud story alongside AWS (5 skills) and GCP (3 skills).
- FR-013 enforces read-only by default with ITSM-gated write operations, consistent with NetClaw's security posture.
- SC-007 (artifact coherence) ensures the Azure MCP server ships with the same artifact structure as existing AWS and GCP servers.
- Sovereign clouds (Azure Government, Azure China) are explicitly scoped out for v1 in the assumptions.
