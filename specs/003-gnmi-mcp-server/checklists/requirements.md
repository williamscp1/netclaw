# Specification Quality Checklist: gNMI Streaming Telemetry MCP Server

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-03-26
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass. Spec is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
- The spec references gNMI as the protocol interface but does not
  prescribe implementation technology (no gRPC libraries, languages,
  or frameworks are named), keeping it technology-agnostic at the
  spec level.
- FR-004 enforces ITSM gating for gNMI Set operations, aligning with
  NetClaw constitution principles for write-operation governance.
- SC-008 (artifact coherence) ensures constitution principle XI
  compliance is baked into the success criteria.
- Nine edge cases cover TLS, encoding, vendor dialect, and failure
  scenarios to ensure robustness requirements are captured.
