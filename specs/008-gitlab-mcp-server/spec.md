# Feature Specification: GitLab MCP Server Integration

**Feature Branch**: `008-gitlab-mcp-server`
**Created**: 2026-03-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Integrate GitLab MCP server into netclaw for repository, pipeline, issue, and merge request management via Model Context Protocol. Two options available: official GitLab MCP server (beta, OAuth 2.0, Premium/Ultimate) and community @zereight/mcp-gitlab (98+ tools, TypeScript, PAT/OAuth)."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Query Issues and Merge Requests (Priority: P1)

As a network engineer or DevOps operator, I want to search, list, and inspect GitLab issues and merge requests from my AI assistant, so I can track work items, review change proposals, and understand project status without switching to the GitLab web interface.

**Why this priority**: Issue and merge request visibility is the foundational read-only capability. Network teams use GitLab issues to track configuration changes, outages, and feature requests. Merge requests represent pending infrastructure-as-code changes. This aligns with the constitution's "read-before-write" principle (II) and provides immediate value with zero risk.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by asking "show me open issues in project network-automation" or "list merge requests awaiting review" and verifying that accurate issue and MR data is returned with correct titles, states, assignees, and labels.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a GitLab project has open issues, **When** the operator requests a list of issues, **Then** the system returns issues with their title, state, assignee, labels, and creation date.

2. **Given** a GitLab project has open merge requests, **When** the operator requests merge request details for a specific MR, **Then** the system returns the MR title, description, source/target branches, approval status, and diff summary.

3. **Given** the operator wants to find issues assigned to them across projects, **When** they request "my issues", **Then** the system returns all issues assigned to the authenticated user across accessible projects.

4. **Given** GitLab is unreachable or credentials are invalid, **When** the operator attempts any query, **Then** the system returns a clear error message indicating the connectivity or authentication issue without exposing tokens.

### User Story 2 - Monitor CI/CD Pipelines (Priority: P2)

As a network engineer, I want to view pipeline status, inspect job logs, and track pipeline executions from my AI assistant, so I can monitor network automation pipelines (config validation, compliance checks, deployment) and troubleshoot failures quickly.

**Why this priority**: Pipeline monitoring is the CI/CD observability layer. Network teams rely on GitLab CI/CD to validate and deploy infrastructure changes. Quick access to pipeline status and job logs is critical for troubleshooting failed deployments without navigating the GitLab UI.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by requesting "show pipelines for project network-configs" or "get the log for job deploy in pipeline #123" and verifying accurate pipeline and job data is returned.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a GitLab project has pipeline executions, **When** the operator requests a list of pipelines, **Then** the system returns pipelines with their status (running, success, failed, canceled), branch, commit, and trigger information.

2. **Given** a pipeline has jobs, **When** the operator requests job details for a specific pipeline, **Then** the system returns each job's name, stage, status, duration, and runner information.

3. **Given** a pipeline job has completed, **When** the operator requests the job output log, **Then** the system returns the log content with pagination support.

4. **Given** a pipeline is running, **When** the operator requests to cancel or retry the pipeline, **Then** the system executes the action and confirms the updated pipeline status.

### User Story 3 - Browse Repositories and Files (Priority: P3)

As a network engineer, I want to browse repository structure, read file contents, and view commit history from my AI assistant, so I can review network configuration files, understand recent changes, and inspect infrastructure-as-code without cloning repositories locally.

**Why this priority**: Repository browsing provides the code context needed to understand what network configurations exist and what has changed. This supports root-cause analysis and change review but depends on knowing which projects to look at (from US1 issue/MR context).

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by requesting "show the directory structure of project network-configs" or "show me the contents of ansible/site.yml" and verifying accurate file content and tree structure are returned.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a GitLab project has files, **When** the operator requests the repository tree, **Then** the system returns the directory structure with file and folder names, types, and sizes.

2. **Given** a file exists in a repository, **When** the operator requests the file contents, **Then** the system returns the file content with correct encoding.

3. **Given** a repository has commits, **When** the operator requests the commit history, **Then** the system returns commits with hash, author, message, and timestamp.

4. **Given** two branches exist, **When** the operator requests a diff between them, **Then** the system returns the file-level changes between the branches.

### User Story 4 - Manage Issues and Merge Requests (Priority: P4)

As a network engineer, I want to create issues, update issue status, create merge requests, and add comments from my AI assistant, so I can manage network change workflows end-to-end without context-switching.

**Why this priority**: Write operations on issues and merge requests complete the workflow loop. Operators can create a ticket for a network issue, then create an MR with the fix, all from the assistant. This is gated by the constitution's "human-in-the-loop" principle (XIV) — explicit operator approval before write actions.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by requesting "create an issue in project network-automation titled 'BGP peer flapping on router-01'" and verifying the issue is created with the correct title and returns the issue URL.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a GitLab project, **When** the operator requests to create a new issue with a title and description, **Then** the system creates the issue and returns the issue number and URL.

2. **Given** an existing issue, **When** the operator requests to update its labels or assignee, **Then** the system updates the issue and confirms the changes.

3. **Given** a source and target branch exist, **When** the operator requests to create a merge request, **Then** the system creates the MR with the specified title, description, and branch configuration.

4. **Given** an existing merge request, **When** the operator requests to add a comment or approve the MR, **Then** the system posts the comment or records the approval.

### User Story 5 - Manage Labels, Milestones, and Releases (Priority: P5)

As a project lead, I want to manage labels, milestones, and releases from my AI assistant, so I can organize and track project progress for network infrastructure initiatives.

**Why this priority**: Project management entities (labels, milestones, releases) support organizational workflows but are not core to day-to-day network operations. They enhance the integration for teams using GitLab for full project lifecycle management.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by requesting "list milestones for project network-automation" or "create a label called 'critical-infrastructure'" and verifying accurate data is returned or the entity is created.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a GitLab project, **When** the operator requests a list of milestones, **Then** the system returns milestones with their title, due date, progress, and status.

2. **Given** a project, **When** the operator requests to create a label with a name and color, **Then** the system creates the label and confirms.

3. **Given** a project with releases, **When** the operator requests release details, **Then** the system returns the release name, tag, description, and associated assets.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the operator queries a project they do not have permission to access?
- How does the system handle GitLab instances with rate limiting enabled — are requests throttled gracefully?
- What happens when a merge request has conflicts and the operator attempts to merge it?
- How does the system handle very large repositories with thousands of files in the tree listing?
- What happens when the GitLab instance is self-hosted with a self-signed TLS certificate?
- How does the system handle projects in deeply nested groups (e.g., "org/team/sub-team/project")?
- What happens when the personal access token expires or is revoked mid-session?
- How does the system handle GitLab wiki pages with embedded images or attachments?

## Assumptions

- A GitLab instance (gitlab.com or self-hosted) is already deployed and accessible over the network from the machine running the AI assistant. This integration does not manage GitLab deployment.
- The operator has generated a GitLab Personal Access Token with appropriate scopes (api, read_api, read_repository, etc.) for the operations they need. This integration does not manage GitLab user accounts or permissions.
- The community MCP server (@zereight/mcp-gitlab) is the primary integration target due to its comprehensive tool coverage (98+ tools), support for both PAT and OAuth authentication, and active maintenance (1.3k+ stars, 81 contributors). The official GitLab MCP server (beta, Premium/Ultimate only) is noted as an alternative for teams with GitLab Premium/Ultimate subscriptions.
- GitLab is accessible via HTTPS with a valid TLS certificate, or the operator has configured the integration to accept self-signed certificates.
- The integration will use stdio transport by default (running the MCP server as a local process) with Streamable HTTP available as an alternative for shared/multi-user deployments.
- Write operations (issue creation, MR creation, pipeline control) follow the constitution's "human-in-the-loop" principle (XIV) — the AI assistant will confirm with the operator before executing mutating actions.
- Rate limiting behavior varies between gitlab.com and self-hosted instances. The integration handles rate-limit responses gracefully with appropriate backoff.
- The GitLab instance version supports the REST API endpoints used by the MCP server. Older self-hosted instances may not support all features.
